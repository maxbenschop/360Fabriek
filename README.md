# Enhanced Hackathon Experience at Hogeschool Rotterdam

For a November hackathon, my friends and I tackled the challenge of integrating 3D objects from 360 Fabriek to foster a social connection with historical monuments. Our outcome is a mobile app prototype that allows users to purchase monument pieces, earn coins through exploration, and redeem them for museum tickets. Additionally, users can engage by commenting and sharing opinions on each monument.
